In this project our goal is to develop a computer vision and artificial intelligence-based system to be used in the real-time or offline differentiation (and characterization) of colon polyps that are known to be the precursors of colon cancer. 
The system will use image/video processing, machine learning and deep learning approaches. It is expected to provide a real-time optical biopsy opportunity to the endoscopists to examine the polyps in terms of type, phase, malignancy potential, etc. during the colonoscopy procedure without a need to send the extracted tissue to the pathology clinic. The system will allow to make sense of the molecular level of the tissues from the colonoscopy and histopathology images.
