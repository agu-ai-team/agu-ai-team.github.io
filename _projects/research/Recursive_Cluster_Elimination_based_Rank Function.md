front_page_abstract: We have empowered SVM-RCE approach with a novel ranking function to classify gene expression data (SVM-RCE-R). Now users can specify the different weights for different classification metrics (Specificity, Precision, F-measure). Thereby allowing users to specify which classification metric should be prioritized according to their needs.
