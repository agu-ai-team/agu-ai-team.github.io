# Research Problem
Wildfires is a great threat throughout the world and among the foremost devastating natural disasters that can have immediate and long-term effects on environment, people and as a result an immense impact on the economy. In favorable conditions, spread speed of bushfires can attain as high as *24* km/h which makes its suppression extremely hard.  Therefore, one of the most crucial step in firefighting is early detection of the fire after the ignition.

Merve is developing deep learninig based daytime wildfire detection algorithms while Ahmet is addressing the nighttime forest fires.
