# You can Use this website as a template for your academic research group

This website is using Jekyll static web genarator and a free Github for hosting. It is based on Allan's labs website but this site has been greatly modified.

See this [link](https://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html).

Code is released under the MIT License. 

Thanks to [Allan Lab](https://www.allanlab.org/) for providing this template for researchers for free.

# How to use this template
I will add a documentation soon (hopefuly).
